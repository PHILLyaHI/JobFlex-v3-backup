// `/` — the landing. landing-e, promoted (owner call, 2026-09-16).
//
// landing-d carried the root from 2026-08-25; landing-e was its test copy at
// /landing-e (2026-09-10) with the honest trial copy, the three-field
// register, the first-estimate card, the welcome email and Google One Tap.
// The owner kept e and dropped d: this renders <LandingE /> from
// components/v3/landing-e, /landing-e redirects here, and landing-d is gone.
// Signed-in visitors are sent to work instead of to a pitch.
//
// TRADE VARIANT (2026-09-06). `?industry=fencing` (alias `?trade=`) swaps the
// hero for the fence estimator's; see landing-e/landing-variants.ts. Resolved
// HERE, on the server, from the query ONLY, so the first byte already carries
// the right hero — no client-side detection, no swap after paint. The
// jf_industry cookie is never consulted for the landing (owner, 2026-09-10):
// no parameter is always the default page; the cookie only pre-selects the
// trade on /auth/register. An unknown value is the default page too.
