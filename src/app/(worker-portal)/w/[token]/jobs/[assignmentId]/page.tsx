// WORKER PORTAL · ONE JOB (stage C, 2026-09-30).
//
// The crew's magic-link door onto a job is now the SAME page the dashboard
// shows an installer at /dashboard/jobs/<id>: the blueprint job detail
// (job-detail-blueprint), desk and handheld editions, with the days on site,
// the photos and videos by day and the receipts (components/v3/crew-board).
// Two doors, one set of capabilities — the owner's rule. What differs is how
// a write is authenticated: here the record carries the portal's token and
// every crew write goes to the /api/crew routes that take it
// (lib/crewActor); on the dashboard it is the session.
//
// The old Tailwind work-order page (command hero, WorkerJobPanel with its own
// status buttons, photo grid and receipt form) is retired with this file.
// Accept / Decline moved onto the job's "Your assignment" block. The pick
// list is the blueprint's; "Loaded" stays an office-session action.
