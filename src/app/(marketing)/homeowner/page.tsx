// /homeowner — the public homeowner intake page.
//
// A verbatim port of the approved mockup `jobflex-homeowner (13).html`. The
// page body is a client component (the wizard, the vignettes, the count-up and
// the parallax all need the browser); this file stays a server component so the
// donor's <title> and <meta name="description"> ship as real route metadata.
//
// CONVENTION (2026-08-11): a re-port REPLACES its predecessor in place — same
// route path, same component files, never a parallel `-blueprint` route beside
// the old one. This reverses the earlier side-by-side rule once recorded in
// headers like src/app/dashboard/subscription-blueprint/page.tsx (deleted
// 2026-08-12 when its port was promoted; git history has it) and
// src/app/(auth)/auth/login/page.tsx ("a donor surface is never overwritten by
// its successor").
//
// THE ONE HOMEOWNER PAGE (owner, 2026-10-02). /homeowner is the homeowner
// portal: the intake, the status link and the referral code all live here. The
// older surfaces — the classic form (plural address), the Blueprint portal
// wizard (homeowner-blueprint) and the standalone handheld preview — were
// deleted with their components; their addresses answer 404. What they had and this
// page lacked was carried into the two wizards here, not copied beside them.
//
// CHROME: this is a standalone marketing page carrying the donor's own <nav>
// and <footer>. There is no src/app/(marketing)/layout.tsx, so nothing wraps it
// but the root layout — nothing is doubled. It is deliberately NOT mounted
// inside blueprint-shell.
//
// The figures on the page are static fixture copy and the wizard's attachments
// never leave the browser. The project does: the contact step calls
// submitHomeownerRequest (actions/homeowner), which writes the lead, routes it
// and emails the homeowner their status link.

// RESPONSIVE (2026-08-12): this route serves TWO designs from one URL — the
// desktop build below at >768px, and the handheld rebuild
// (src/components/v3/mobile-homeowner/) at ≤768px. The switch is a media query in
// ./homeowner-responsive.tsx, never user-agent detection, and exactly one tree
// is ever mounted. It lives in a sibling client file because this file has to
// stay a server component for the `metadata` export below.
