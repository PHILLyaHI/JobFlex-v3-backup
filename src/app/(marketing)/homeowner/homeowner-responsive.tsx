// Viewport switch for /homeowner.
//
// One URL, two designs: the desktop marketing page above 768px, the handheld
// rebuild at or below it. The switch is a MEDIA QUERY, never the user agent —
// the mobile-first rule forbids UA detection, and a query is also the only
// thing that makes DevTools' device toolbar work: drag the viewport under
// 768px and the surface swaps live, no reload and no second URL to remember.
//
// This lives beside page.tsx rather than inside it because page.tsx must stay
// a SERVER component — it is where `export const metadata` ships the donor's
// <title> and <meta name="description"> as real route metadata, and "use
// client" would break that export. Same file, same folder, same owner; the
// switch is simply the client half of the route.
//
// It is a local copy of the house pattern in
// src/components/v3/responsive-shell/responsive-dashboard-shell.tsx and NOT an
// edit to it: that module is the dashboard fleet's, keyed by pathname against
// BlueprintShell, and /homeowner has no shell at all — it is a standalone
// marketing route under the root layout. Bending the dashboard shell around a
// shell-less public page would couple two things that have nothing in common.
//
// EXACTLY ONE TREE IS MOUNTED, never both. The two builds each ship a plain,
// root-class-prefixed stylesheet with its own `body:has()` host neutralizers;
// rendering both would put two competing page roots, two <symbol> sprites and
// two sets of `:has()` gates in the same document at once.
