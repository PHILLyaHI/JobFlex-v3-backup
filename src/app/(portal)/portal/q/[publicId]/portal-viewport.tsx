// PUBLIC PROPOSAL PORTAL — the viewport switch.
// Route: /portal/q/[publicId].
//
// One URL, two designs: the desktop tree above 768px, the handheld rebuild at
// or below it. The switch is a MEDIA QUERY, never the user agent — CLAUDE.md's
// mobile-first rule forbids UA detection, and a query is also the only thing
// that makes DevTools' device toolbar work: drag the viewport under 768px and
// the surface swaps live, with no reload and no second URL to remember.
//
// Same shape as src/components/v3/responsive-shell/responsive-dashboard-shell.tsx,
// which is the house pattern — but written here rather than added there. That
// file switches whole /dashboard SHELLS keyed on pathname; this route has no
// shell at all (the `(portal)` group has no layout.tsx, and must not grow one:
// the reader is a homeowner, not a signed-in contractor), and it is a dynamic
// segment, so it does not fit that registry.
//
// EXACTLY ONE TREE IS MOUNTED, NEVER BOTH. The desktop tree arrives as
// `children` — still server-rendered, still the same RSC output — and is simply
// not placed in the tree when the handheld build is showing. Rendering both
// would put two copies of every literal DOM id from the mockup (#pvBtns,
// #pvNote, #pvErr) in one document and double the page's whole reading order
// for a screen reader.
//
// ── SSR IS NOT LOST ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// This is the surface a homeowner opens from an email and the return_url
// PayPal and Square bounce back to, so the server work stays on the server:
// page.tsx still does the Prisma read, still writes the VIEWED side-effect,
// still exports generateMetadata, and hands the handheld tree a fully
// formatted, serialisable view object. The handheld component fetches nothing.
//
// The dynamic() import is `ssr: false` because the switch cannot be evaluated
// on a server that has no viewport — the same trade the dashboard shell makes.
// The first paint on a phone is therefore the SSR'd desktop tree, replaced on
// hydration; `loading` is a paper-coloured full-bleed hold so the one chunk
// fetch reads as a load rather than a flash of nothing.
