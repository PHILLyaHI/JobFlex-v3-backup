//
// The handheld surface is mounted PROPS-LESS from two places (its own route at
// /mobile-workers-v2, and responsive-dashboard-shell at ≤768px on the live
// /dashboard/workers), so it cannot be handed a server component's data the way
// the desktop sheet is. It asks for the roster itself, once, on mount — the
// same shape mobile-clients-v2 settled on (see ./client-book.ts's sibling
// rationale in the clients folder).
//
// THE QUERY IS THE DESKTOP PAGE'S, duplicated in shape rather than
// approximated: same organizationId scope, same displayName ordering, same
// SCHEDULED/IN_PROGRESS assignment join, same "role comes from Membership, not
// from WorkerProfile" map, same JSON specialties parse and the same short
// "Mar 2024" joined plate. Both editions therefore describe the same roster,
// and the ids in these rows are the ids the worker actions write against. If
// the desktop query changes, this one changes with it.
//
// Scoped through requireOrg like every neighbouring read: the org id is never
// taken from the client.
