//
// The handheld surface is mounted PROPS-LESS from two places (its own route at
// /mobile-clients-v2, and responsive-dashboard-shell at ≤768px on the live
// /dashboard/clients), so it cannot be handed a server component's data the way
// the desktop sheet is. It asks for the book itself, once, on mount.
//
// THE QUERY IS THE DESKTOP PAGE'S, deliberately duplicated in shape rather than
// approximated: same `deletedAt: null` filter, same proposal join, same
// pipeline formula, same "VIP is an org Tag, not a column" rule, same
// updatedAt-desc ordering. Both editions therefore describe the same book, and
// the ids in these rows are the ids proposals, jobs and the record page
// reference. If the desktop formula changes, this one changes with it.
//
// Scoped through requireOrg like every neighbouring read: a signed-in user with
// no membership has no book to show, and the org id is never taken from the
// client.
