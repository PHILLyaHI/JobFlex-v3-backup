// The handheld build is mounted TWO ways: from its own route
// (/mobile-leads-v2/page.tsx) and, at ≤768px, from the viewport switch in
// components/v3/responsive-shell/responsive-dashboard-shell.tsx, which renders
// it with NO props. So the page cannot hand it server rows; it reads them
// itself, on mount, through this action.
//
// The query is the DESKTOP sheet's, verbatim (src/app/dashboard/leads/page.tsx)
// — same org scope, same sales-visibility slice, same ordering, same 24h offer
// window — so the two editions describe one pipeline. Writes go through the
// shared lead actions (@/actions/leads, @/actions/leadOffers); nothing is
// mutated here.
