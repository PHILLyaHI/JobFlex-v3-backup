// Mobile phone — mobile-phone-v2. A handheld-first rebuild of the Phone
// surface in the Blueprint design system, sibling to /mobile-v2 (Overview),
// /mobile-clients-v2, /mobile-proposals-v2 and the rest of the handheld fleet.
// Lives beside the desktop /dashboard/phone rather than replacing it, per the
// mobile route strategy — and since 2026-09-03 it is the SECOND entry point
// to the same build /dashboard/phone mounts at ≤768px (see
// app/dashboard/phone/phone-responsive.tsx).
//
// Built with the jobflex-page-styler skill (visual system: tokens, palette,
// type scale, Motion System "Balanced", the mobile fluid scale) and the
// mobile-app-ui-design skill (structure: thumb zone, ≥44px targets, bottom
// sheets over modals, a real dial pad instead of a desktop table row).
//
// Data: REAL. The same loader the desktop page runs
// (app/dashboard/phone/load-phone) reads the org's AiPhoneCall rows, the three
// stat counts, the Twilio state and the webhook URL, and hands them down as
// props; nothing here is a fixture. The loader also owns the auth ladder
// (login redirect, no-org), with this route as the return path.
