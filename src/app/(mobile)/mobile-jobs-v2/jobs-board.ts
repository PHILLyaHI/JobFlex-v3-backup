// MOBILE JOBS — the server read.
//
// The handheld surface is mounted PROPS-LESS from two places (its own route at
// /mobile-jobs-v2, and responsive-dashboard-shell at ≤768px on the live
// /dashboard/jobs), so it cannot be handed a server component's data the way
// the desktop sheet is. It asks for the board itself, on mount and again after
// every write — exactly the arrangement mobile-clients-v2/client-book.ts
// established.
//
// THE QUERY IS THE DESKTOP PAGE'S (src/app/dashboard/jobs/page.tsx),
// deliberately duplicated in shape rather than approximated: same field-worker
// scoping, same `createdAt: desc` ordering, same client/assignment joins, same
// two option lists. The proposal list is the classic /dashboard/jobs/new page's
// query, because the create sheet replaces that form on this surface. If the
// desktop board changes, this changes with it.
//
// Scoped through requireOrg like every neighbouring read: a signed-in user with
// no membership has no board to show, and the org id is never taken from the
// client.
