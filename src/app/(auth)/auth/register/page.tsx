// Create account — Blueprint edition. Pixel-identical port of the donor
// `jobflex-auth-register-blueprint.html`.
//
// REPLACED IN PLACE, not forked. /auth/register is the live registration
// surface and now serves the blueprint build directly; there is deliberately no
// parallel /auth/register-blueprint route. This REVERSES the earlier
// side-by-side convention recorded in the header of
// /dashboard/subscription-blueprint/page.tsx ("a donor surface is never
// overwritten by its successor") — replacement is the instruction now.
//
// Public route: registration necessarily runs before a session exists, so there
// is no auth check here, exactly as before.
//
// All registration logic is unchanged — registerAccount (server action) +
// next-auth signIn + the promo/referral attribution capture. No server action,
// API route or Prisma model was added or altered by the restyle.

// VIEWPORT SWITCH: this route now serves the handheld rebuild at ≤768px and the
// blueprint desktop build above it, from this one URL — see
// ./register-responsive.tsx for the mechanism and why it is a sibling file
// rather than inline. /mobile-v1/auth/register remains as a direct preview URL.

/* STEP 1 BEFORE THE JAVASCRIPT (2026-10-04). On a phone the fields are drawn
   about three seconds before the page's script takes them over, and until
   then a Continue press was a plain browser submit — the page reloaded empty,
   the ad's tags gone — and anything typed was wiped the moment React took
   over. This runs as the HTML streams in, ahead of the form: it holds an
   early Continue, keeps what was typed and notes both moments;
   register-content restores the fields when it is live and reports them to
   the analyst as `signup_step1`. Plain script on purpose: it has to run
   before any bundle has arrived. */
