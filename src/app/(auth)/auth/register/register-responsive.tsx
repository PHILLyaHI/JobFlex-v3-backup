// Viewport switch for /auth/register.
//
// One URL, two designs: the blueprint desktop build above 768px, the handheld
// rebuild at or below it. The switch is a MEDIA QUERY, never the user agent —
// the mobile-first rule forbids UA detection, and a query is also the only
// thing that makes DevTools' device toolbar work: drag the viewport under
// 768px and the surface swaps live, no reload and no second URL to remember.
//
// WHY A SIBLING FILE HERE, but an inline switch on /auth/login. This page is a
// server component (it owns `metadata`), so the switch has to be a separate
// client module regardless. Login's page is already `"use client"` and its
// desktop tree is defined in the same file, so a sibling switch there would
// have to import from the page while the page imported the switch — a cycle.
//
// EXACTLY ONE TREE IS MOUNTED, never both. Both branches call the same
// `registerAccount` server action and both mount the attribution capture that
// reads ?promo / ?ref; two live trees would put a second set of account fields
// in the tab order and run the capture twice against one page view.
//
// The handheld build previously shipped only at /mobile-v1/auth/register,
// which nothing linked to. That preview URL still works; this is what makes
// the real URL serve it.

  /* PHASES THE HANDHELD BUILD DOES NOT IMPLEMENT (owner's report, 2026-09-03:
     "mobile authentication with Google doesn't work"). The handheld register is
     still the pre-paywall flow — it reads neither `?gsu=` (the return from
     Google) nor `?signup=` (the plan step and the return from Stripe), so a
     phone visitor who signed in with Google landed back on an empty step 1.
     For those two phases the blueprint build is mounted at every width; its
     stylesheet carries ≤1000px and ≤560px layouts, so it is a real phone
     layout rather than a desktop page squeezed onto a phone.
     This is a BRIDGE, not the destination: the handheld build still needs the
     pending-signup + plan port for its own password path. */

     Stripe return. The blueprint build carries ≤1000px / ≤768px / ≤560px
     layouts (a phone carousel for the plan step) so it is a real phone layout,
