// Public proposal REVERT — the homeowner takes back a DECLINE they did not
// mean, from the same page, while it is still open.

// Guarded by the signed token ../decline hands back (see lib/quoteRevert.ts):
// it names the proposal, the action and the status to put back. Without a
// valid token there is nothing here to call.
//
// AN ACCEPTANCE IS FINAL FOR THE CLIENT (owner, 2026-09-23). ../accept no
// longer hands back a token, and an accept claim — however it was made, a
// token from before the change included — is refused here with 403 before
// anything is read or written. Undoing an acceptance is the contractor's
// call, in the dashboard (updateProposalStatus), with its own activity.
