// Blueprint layout — wraps the promoted blueprint pages (/dashboard and
// /dashboard/proposals) in the shared donor shell, so the sidebar and topbar
// mount once and persist across navigation between them.
//
// Scope: this layout only covers routes under src/app/dashboard/. The
// classic-shell children (/dashboard/proposals/new, /create, /[id], /ai,
// /templates and the rest) live under the (dashboard) route group, a separate
// branch of the tree, and keep their own layout untouched.
//
// The shell is wrapped in ResponsiveDashboardShell rather than mounted
// directly (owner's call, 2026-07-29): at ≤768px the two routes that have a
// handheld build serve it from this same URL, so the mobile design is reachable
// by resizing /dashboard into iPhone view instead of navigating to /mobile-v2.
// The switch lives at the LAYOUT, not in the pages, because the handheld build
// brings its own complete chrome — it replaces the shell, it does not render
// inside it.
