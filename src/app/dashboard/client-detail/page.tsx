// Client detail — house blueprint skin (route: /dashboard/client-detail).
//
// The old record page at /dashboard/clients/[id] is deliberately NOT replaced.
// The two stand side by side so the composition can be judged before anything
// is migrated: this one is a stack of five differently-shaped bands, that one
// is a three-column grid of four same-weight cards.
//
// Top-level route under /dashboard on purpose: blueprint-shell's pageKey()
// reads the first path segment, so a child route would inherit its parent's
// page key and stylesheet. "client-detail" is deliberately absent from the
// shell's PAGE_STYLES map — this page carries its own self-scoped module
// instead (see the scoping note at the top of client-detail.module.css).
//
// NO LONGER A FIXTURE. `?client=<id>` — the param the clients list has been
// putting in the URL since the record became this page's destination — is read
// here and the row behind it is loaded by ./client-detail-load. The fixture
// survives as the FALLBACK for the bare route and for an id that resolves to
// nothing, so the composition stays reviewable without a database row to point
// at, and a stale link shows a page rather than a 404.
//
// The id is a query param and not a path segment because the route has no [id]
// dynamic segment: adding one would make this a child route, and a child route
// inherits its parent's page key, which is the one thing the placement note
// above exists to avoid.
