// Smart Proposal · Estimate — Blueprint edition. Pixel-identical port of the
// canonical donor `jobflex-smartproposal-estimate-blueprint (8).html`.
//
// The route segment is `advanced-ai` (the app's existing URL for this screen);
// the donor file is named "smartproposal-estimate" and its visible title and
// heading text are kept exactly as authored. "AI" must never appear in the
// interface — the feature is called Smart Proposal.
//
// The sidebar, topbar and sprite come from the shared shell mounted in
// ../layout.tsx, so this page renders only the donor's `.content` children.
// The child routes (/roof, /fence, /fence/studio) live under the (dashboard)
// route group and keep the classic layout.
//
// ── THIS REPLACED A WIRED CONSOLE ──────────────────────────────────
// The previous build at this URL was a port of an EARLIER donor
// (jobflex-smart-proposal-blueprint_4.html) wired to real data: it read the
// org's hidden material/labour markup so the Totals card could state the price
// `convertEstimateToProposal` would write, resolved `?client=<id>` against the
// org, and gated intake behind a clarifying-questions dialog.
//
// None of that survives here. Shipping the donor's demo estimate verbatim was
// the explicit call for this port, so the page takes no props, reads no rows
// and writes nothing; `advanced-ai-behavior.ts` and `advanced-ai-clarify.ts`
// were removed with the console they served. Git history has them if any of it
// needs to come back.
//
// `?client=<id>` is therefore no longer read. The estimator picker still
// appends it when the studio is opened from a client's record — the parameter
// is simply inert, which is why the auth gate below is all that remains of the
// old server component.
