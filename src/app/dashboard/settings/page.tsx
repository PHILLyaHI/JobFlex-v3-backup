// Settings — Blueprint edition. Port of the canonical settings donor
// (jobflex-settings-blueprint (6).html), with the owner's fix list applied on
// top (F1-F18: the three-column security row, the flush danger row, the
// processor cleanup, the custom dropdowns, the add-payout modal, the icon-less
// toggles, the notification event icons and column toggles).
//
// The sidebar, topbar, graph-paper field and shared sprite come from the shell
// mounted in ../layout.tsx, so this page renders only the donor's `.content`
// children. The classic settings index that used to serve this URL — a bare
// redirect to /dashboard/settings/account — was archived to
// old-design-pages/dashboard/settings/page.tsx.
//
// Its CHILD routes are untouched: /dashboard/settings/account, /billing,
// /team, /gmail, /meta and the rest still live under the (dashboard) route
// group and keep the classic layout.
//
// THE READ NOW LIVES IN src/lib/settings/loadSettingsData.ts. It was lifted out
// of this file unchanged when the handheld build (/mobile-settings-v1) arrived,
// so both surfaces fold one `SettingsData` object from one set of queries. It
// is a plain module, NOT "use server": an exported async function in an action
// file is a public RPC endpoint, so a read keyed by a caller-supplied org id
// would be a data leak. It takes the org context THIS page already resolved.
//
// Writes reuse what already existed wherever possible —
// `updatePaymentSettings` / `updateGmailSettings` / `updateMetaSettings` /
// `disconnectGmail` from src/actions/settings.ts — plus the three new
// account-scoped writes in src/actions/accountSettings.ts.
