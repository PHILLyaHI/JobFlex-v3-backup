// SUBSCRIPTION — BLUEPRINT · page fixtures.
// Route: /dashboard/subscription (promoted 2026-08-12; ported at
// /dashboard/subscription-blueprint, which no longer exists).
//
// From the "ДАННЫЕ СТРАНИЦЫ" (page data) block of the approved mockup,
// jobflex-subscription-blueprint (8).html — with one owner-directed revision
// (2026-08-17): the Free tier is removed from the product, so the fixture org
// is on Professional. The plan list, the feature-matrix indexes, the usage
// caps and the invoice amounts were re-authored for that story; everything
// else ships as the mockup wrote it.
//
// STATIC BY DESIGN. There is no data layer here: no server action, no API
// route, no Prisma query and — deliberately, on a billing surface — no Stripe
// call. Written while this layout was under review at the staging route; the
// rationale stands after promotion, because a mock that silently talked to the
// real billing system would be the worst possible way to find out it was still
// a mock. Live wiring is a separate, not-yet-assigned task.
