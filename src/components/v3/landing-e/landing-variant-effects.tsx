/* Invisible. Two side effects of a landing view, both after paint:

   1. MEMORY. When the variant came from an explicit `?industry=` the page
      remembers it for 30 days in a first-party cookie, the same way the promo
      capture remembers `?promo=`. The cookie is for /auth/register ONLY — it
      pre-selects the trade when the visitor arrives there later with no
      parameter (and on the return from Google). The landing itself never
      reads it (owner, 2026-09-10): no parameter is always the default page.

   2. ANALYTICS. One `landing_view` per page load with the industry that was
      shown ("default" when none) and whatever utm_* the visit carried. Goes
      through trackTraffic, which queues until PostHog is initialised and
      never throws.

   3. META ViewContent (owner, 2026-10-01 — reverses "no Meta Pixel here" of
      2026-09-06): once per page load, content_name = the trade ("Roofing";
      "default" without one),
      browser + server with one event_id (lib/metaEvents). Needs marketing
      consent; a visitor who gives it on this page is counted then. Sent a
      tick after mount, so the layout's pixel has sent its PageView first. */
