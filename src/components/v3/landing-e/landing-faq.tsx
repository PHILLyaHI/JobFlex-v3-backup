/* Six questions (CRO stage 2, 2026-09-09). The fourth is the trade's: the
   roofing and fencing heroes promise a measurement, so they get "where do
   the figures come from" (aerial data, never a provider's name); every other
   trade gets how a description is priced.
   FAQ CARDS (owner, 2026-09-26): Blueprint cards — white, 2px ink frame, hard
   ink offset — that show only the question. Hover (or keyboard focus) turns
   the card to ink with the answer in white; with no hover (a phone) a tap
   toggles it. The question layer and the answer layer share ONE grid cell,
   so the card is always as tall as its answer and nothing moves when it
   opens (pricing-faq.css, .lp-faq-*). The wipe is a calm 0.4s (2026-09-26).
   On a phone (≤768px) the six cards are a two-row swipe carousel, three
   columns of two, with the next column showing at the right edge. */
