// Proposals blueprint — the row shape the page renders.
//
// There is NO fixture in this module any more. Every row the page draws is read
// from the database in src/app/dashboard/proposals/page.tsx and handed to
// `ProposalsContent`, which passes it to the behavior module (same
// write-once-useRef pattern as Workers). The donor's embedded demo array — 16
// invented proposals that used to render whenever `options.rows` was omitted —
// was deleted on 2026-08-13: a fallback that prints invented records is worse
// than an empty book, and the only caller always supplies real rows.
//
// Every field the row menu needs to reach a REAL implementation lives on the
// row: `id` is the proposal's cuid (the editor route and every server action
// key off it), `publicId` builds the portal link, `zillow` is the prebuilt
// search URL (null = the client has no address, which is what disables that
// menu item), `materials` is the line-item set the materials sheet shops, and
// `before` / `after` are the persisted completion photos.
