// VIEWPORT SWITCH for /dashboard/projects/[id].
//
// The desktop blueprint page above 768px, the handheld rebuild at or below it,
// from ONE URL — the same contract the other 24 promoted routes get from
// responsive-shell/responsive-dashboard-shell.tsx, and written to the same
// rules:
//
//   · the switch is a MEDIA QUERY, never the user agent. CLAUDE.md's
//     mobile-first rule forbids UA detection, and a query is also the only
//     thing that makes DevTools' device toolbar work: drag the viewport under
//     768px and the surface swaps live, no reload and no second URL.
//   · EXACTLY ONE TREE IS MOUNTED, NEVER BOTH. The handheld shell is
//     `position: fixed; inset: 0` and its mount effect locks body scrolling;
//     rendering it over a live desktop shell would strand the desktop page's
//     scroll and leave the sidebar's twenty-odd links in the tab order
//     underneath an opaque overlay.
//   · `dynamic(…, { ssr: false, loading: MobileHold })`, so a desktop visitor
//     never downloads the handheld bundle and the one chunk fetch that happens
//     when the viewport first crosses 768px is covered by a paper-coloured
//     full-bleed hold instead of blinking through to blank.
//
// ── WHY THIS ROUTE SWITCHES HERE AND NOT IN THE SHELL ──────────────────────
// HANDHELD_SURFACES in responsive-dashboard-shell.tsx is `Record<pathname,
// ComponentType>`: keyed by an EXACT pathname, rendering a component that takes
// no props. Neither half fits this route. It is dynamic — /dashboard/projects/
// cmomfzw8m001fyb33mz3lis5d — so no literal key can match it; and its handheld
// build needs the project, its jobs and the attachable-job candidates, which
// are read in the page's server component and cannot reach a props-less
// component mounted by the layout. Fetching them again from the client would
// mean a new API route or a new server action, and the data layer is out of
// scope.
//
// So the PAGE owns the switch and the shell steps out of the way: the one entry
// added to that file is a guard that, at ≤768px on this route, renders the page
// bare instead of wrapping it in BlueprintShell. Both sides read the same
// `(max-width: 768px)` query, so they flip in the same commit — the desktop
// content is never left standing without its shell, and the handheld tree is
// never mounted inside one.
