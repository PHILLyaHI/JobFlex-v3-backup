// Auth · Create account — Blueprint edition. Pixel-identical port of
// `jobflex-auth-register-blueprint.html`.
//
// This page is STANDALONE: an auth surface ships its own chrome (brand lockup,
// split layout, dark drafting-sheet right panel) and does NOT mount inside
// components/v3/blueprint-shell — that shell's sidebar + topbar belong to the
// signed-in contractor dashboard. `.bp` is the wrapper that carries the donor's
// `:root` tokens and `body` rules — see the header of auth-register.module.css.
//
// The markup below is the donor's <body> verbatim, in source order:
//   sprite · main.auth ( section.auth-form [ brand · ref-banner · stepper ·
//   step1 · step2 · stepDone ] · aside.auth-side [ side-wash · side-perk ·
//   side-card ] )
//
// Adaptations (format only): HTML attributes become their JSX spellings
// (class → className, …), the donor's HTML entities (&amp; …) become the
// characters they encode, and the donor's three inert `href="…html"` links
// become the app routes they name.
//
// BEHAVIOUR. The donor's own script is ported in full — show/hide password,
// chip toggling with its live counter, the two-step progression with its
// literal validation strings, the perk/Google button label swaps, and the
// `--news-h` measurement that positions the perk block above the quote card.
// Grafted onto it, unchanged, is the live registration wiring the classic
// /auth/register page carried: registerAccount (server action) → next-auth
// signIn, the promo/referral attribution capture, and the Google OAuth entry.
// No server action, API route or Prisma call was added or altered.

                · ONE SHARED FEATURE LIST. Every plan prints the SAME rows: the
                  ones it includes in ink with a tick, the ones it does not in
                  grey with a dash. The gap between the columns is the argument
                  for the bigger plan, and it is visible without reading.
                · LESS TEXT, LOUDER TYPE. The per-plan paragraphs are gone; the
                  price is 44px, the plan name is the mono annotation layer, and
                  nothing on the card is a sentence.
