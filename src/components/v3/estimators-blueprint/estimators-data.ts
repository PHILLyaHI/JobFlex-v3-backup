//
// A fixture, not a query, and deliberately so: WHICH estimators exist is a
// product fact, not org data. The queued entries are honest placeholders for
// trades that have no engine yet — they render disabled and unfocusable rather
// than as buttons that lead nowhere.
//
// ORDER IS THE MOCKUP'S. `jobflex-estimator-picker-blueprint (10).html` lists
// its ENGINES as Manual, Smart Proposal, Roof, Fence — catalogue numbers 03,
// 04, 01, 02 — so the 2×2 block reads Manual/Smart on the top row. The number
// stays on the record as `no`; only the queued stubs print it, which is also
// what the source does (`<i>05</i>Deck`).
