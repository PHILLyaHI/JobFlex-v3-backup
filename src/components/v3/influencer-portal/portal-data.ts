// Partner portal — the shapes the three server pages hand their client
// components. Types only, no queries: each page owns its own reads.
//
// WHAT A PARTNER MAY SEE ABOUT A REFERRED CLIENT. Month, plan, status. Nothing
// else. Before this the Overview rendered the client's ORGANISATION NAME, which
// is the name of a real business that bought software — a partner who referred
// them is owed commission, not a customer list. So ReferredClientDTO carries no
// name, no email, no slug, no Stripe customer or subscription id, and not even
// the organisation id: an opaque row id is all a React key needs, and an org id
// is a handle to the business.
//
// The month is a MONTH, formatted on the server, not a timestamp — "March 2026",
// not the day and hour a particular business started paying.
