// FOCUS CARD — shapes only. No values, no React, no imports.
//
// Route: /dashboard/manual-focus (manual proposal builder, card-lab variant).
//
// THESIS (why these shapes and not the live builder's)
// Attention is the scarce resource, not screen space. Ten cards stack down one
// column; exactly ONE of them is LIVE (full ink, controls open) and every other
// stands down to a quiet SUMMARY face that still prints its real content. So the
// draft has to be readable in two registers at once — as editable fields for the
// live card, and as a one-glance summary for the nine that are not — which is
// why every value below is a plain, summarisable scalar and nothing is hidden
// behind a component's internal state.
//
// FIXTURE-ONLY. These types never touch Prisma, a server action or the network;
// the whole page is component-local `useState` over the fixtures in
// ./manual-focus-data.ts. Ids carry an `mc_` prefix for exactly that reason.

/**
 * The ten measurement units, matching the original Job-FLEX picker.

 * Was six ("SQFT | LINEAR_FT | CUBIC_FT | UNIT | HOUR | LUMP_SUM"). CUBIC_FT
 * and LUMP_SUM are gone because nothing in any fixture used them; LUMP_SUM's
 * job is now FIXED, which is what the original calls it.
 *
 * LF and LINEAR_FT are BOTH here, and both mean linear feet. That is a
 * duplicate in the original picker, carried over deliberately so the list
 * matches what the owner is used to — it is a product decision to remove, not
 * a bug to fix silently. If it goes, LF is the one to drop.
 *
 * NOT the Prisma `measurementType` enum. That is still the original six
 * (see actions/proposals.ts), so whichever line-item design wins needs a
 * mapping on the way to the database — the four new units have no column
 * value yet. Flagged here rather than discovered later.
