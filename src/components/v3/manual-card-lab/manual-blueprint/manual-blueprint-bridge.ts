// MANUAL PROPOSAL / BLUEPRINT — the data bridge.
//
// Route: /dashboard/manual-blueprint.
//
// The one place the builder's `Draft` and the database's `Proposal` are
// translated into each other. It is a separate module, and pure, for two
// reasons: the server loader (manual-blueprint-load.ts) and the client column
// (manual-blueprint-content.tsx) BOTH need the mapping, and a translation that
// lives inside a component is a translation that gets quietly duplicated the
// first time a second caller needs half of it.
//
// ── WHAT ROUND-TRIPS AND WHAT DOES NOT ──────────────────────────────
// Persisted through `saveProposal`: title, client, description (Overview),
// scope of work, internal notes, job address, tax rate, the four markup rates,
// the discount, every named line item and the payment schedule.
//
// NOT persisted, because the Proposal table has no column for it and this pass
// adds no schema: the PROJECT pick, the TERMS text, the four "what prints"
// toggles and the staged FILES. Those four controls stay live on the page and
// are re-read from the draft on every keystroke; they simply do not survive a
// reload. Flagged here rather than hidden, and each of the four cards says so.
//
// ── THE UNIT MAP IS LOSSY, ON PURPOSE ───────────────────────────────
// The builder's picker carries the original Job-FLEX list of ten units;
// `LineItem.measurementType` carries the six the schema has always had. Four of
// the ten have no column value, so they land on their nearest neighbour and the
// reverse map cannot tell them apart afterwards:
//     LF, YARDS        → LINEAR_FT   (reopens as "linear ft")
//     SQ_YARDS         → SQFT        (reopens as "sqft")
//     SQ_BOARDS        → UNIT        (reopens as "unit")
//     CU_YARDS         → CUBIC_FT    (reopens as "cu yards" — exact)
// The alternative was inventing a column, which is schema work this pass is not
// allowed to do. The PRICE is unaffected either way: quantity and the
// material/labor split are stored exactly, and the unit is a label on them.
