// MANUAL PROPOSAL / BLUEPRINT — "Payment & deposits".
//
// ── THE RECEIPT LEFT THIS CARD ───────────────────────────────
// This card used to open with the whole money chain — subtotal, discount, tax,
// grand total — printed above the deposit fields. It does not any more. The
// Markup & margin card now owns every figure between the line items and the
// amount the client pays, INCLUDING discount and tax, and it ends on the grand
// total. Printing that same four-row chain again here was the "one number, four
// places" failure at its worst: the same arithmetic, in two cards, a scroll
// apart, with no way for a reader to know which one was authoritative.
//
// What is left is the only question this card was ever really asking: the total
// is $X — WHEN is it paid? The schedule divides a figure produced elsewhere, and
// the coverage meter reports whether the division adds up.
//
// ── THE TOTAL IS STILL PRINTED ONCE, AND ONLY ONCE ───────────
// In the meter's "scheduled $X of $Y" line, which is the one honest reason to
// repeat it: a coverage reading with a single figure in it means nothing. It
// stays at value size, never display size, so it cannot compete with the grand
// total on the card above or with the persistent bar at the foot of the page.
//
// Status colour appears on the coverage reading — meter fill, meter note and the
// percentage readout, which are one reading in three places — and nowhere else.
