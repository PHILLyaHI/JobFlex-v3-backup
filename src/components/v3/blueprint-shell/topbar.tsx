// This is the union of both donors' topbars: the newer proposals donor's
// mobile burger (its drawer is the only way to reach the nav under 860px —
// the older dashboard donor simply hid the sidebar with no way back) plus the
// dashboard donor's ⌘K chip, which the proposals donor dropped but
// decisions.md still lists as part of the mono annotation layer.

// The search field was a dead `<input>` and the ⌘K chip was decoration. Both
// now open the command palette, which the shell renders alongside this bar.
// A button, not an input: the field never accepted typing, so presenting it as
// something you type into was the lie. It opens the thing you type into.

            button in the bottom-right corner loses that corner to the page —
            to whatever a handheld surface pins to the bottom of the screen,
            and on the desk to FloatingCostsCard, permanent furniture on the
            proposal editor. A top bar is the one corner nothing else claims.
