// Roof estimator — the ea9ad01 design, restored one-to-one (owner confirmed
// that commit's look as THE reference), with exactly two differences while the
// drawing engine is reworked (ROOF_DRAWING_ENABLED=false):
//
//   · the 2D | 3D tabs are the same vsw switch, relabelled SATELLITE | ORTHO —
//     SATELLITE (default) is a clean Google Maps satellite photo, ORTHO is the
//     EagleView clear ortho from the measurement (tab hidden when the
//     measurement carries no imagery); no outlines, no lines on either;
//   · everything derived from the drawn MODEL is honestly absent, not zeroed:
//     the layer toggles, PNG/PDF export, LINEAR FOOTAGE and the pitch-mix
//     panel are gone with the drawing. The numbers shown are EagleView
//     Instant's calibrated totals; DETAILS stays (it is Instant data).
//
// Actions: measureRoofInstant / listRoofMeasurements / getRoofMeasurement
// (src/actions/roofMeasurement.ts, data-only) + getMeasurementPhoto (Google
// Static Maps, disk-cached) + getMeasurementOrtho (EagleView clear).
