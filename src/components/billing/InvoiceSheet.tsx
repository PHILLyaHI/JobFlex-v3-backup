/* THE INVOICE SHEET — one form, every surface.
 *
 * Invoicing used to live only on the Proposals rail, driven by that page's own
 * DOM code. The Financials page now raises invoices too, on the desk and on a
 * phone, and all three ask for exactly the same two things: WHICH proposal,
 * and HOW the client may pay. So the form is a component (the ChangeOrderSheet
 * precedent — one sheet mounted from the job, the proposal and now here),
 * rather than a second and third copy of the same two fields.
 *
 * It bills the balance still owing (`installmentId: null`), which is what
 * `sendInstallmentInvoice` does with no stage named, and it only offers a rail
 * the shop can actually take money on (`getInvoiceOptions`).
 *
 * Drawn as a BlueprintSheet (2026-09-19): the Financials page's own "Add an
 * expense" dialog — caps title, mono kickers, ink fields, CANCEL / SEND
 * INVOICE. It used to be the Tailwind side panel, rendered in place, and the
 * blueprint page's `.content` resets stripped it to bare selects and text
 * buttons; the sheet now portals out of that scope and carries its own
 * stylesheet. Same state, same actions, same two questions.
