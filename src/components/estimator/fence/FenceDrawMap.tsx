// Satellite draw surface. Uses an EDITABLE google.maps.Polyline so vertex drag
// and midpoint-insert come for free; we only translate the path to/from local
// feet and push commits to the studio store (debounced to one frame so a drag
// doesn't thrash the 3D rebuild). The store stays the source of truth in feet.
//
// Beyond drawing the run, this surface also:
//   • shows a satellite view immediately (a default lot) so the page is never blank,
//   • uses a crosshair cursor + a live "segment / total" chip that trails the pointer,
//   • rubber-bands a preview line from the last dot to the cursor while tracing,
//   • hosts the Add gate / Add door tools; a click drops the armed opening — snapping
//     onto a run only when it lands very close, otherwise placing it free,
//   • renders each opening as draggable markers (centre = move; attached gates also
//     get two edge handles to set the width).
