// Pure procedural fence geometry — the core engine. THREE-free: given the path
// points (local feet) and optional gates, it returns flat per-instance arrays the
// 3D component streams straight into InstancedMesh matrices, plus the single
// source of truth for total length (reused by pricing so the number can't drift).
//
// Output is HEIGHT- and MATERIAL-independent: posts/pickets/rails are authored at
// unit size and aligned by yaw, so height changes are a cheap matrix re-write
// and material changes a cheap material swap. Only a change in instance COUNT
// (the path, the gates or the build) forces a rebuild.
//
// BUILD (2026-09-28). With `build` (lib/fence/build — the catalog type's own
// parts) the layout is the fence as the crew builds it: posts at the type's
// spacing, its rails at their heights, its infill — butted boards on the
// rails' outside face, spaced pickets, a shadowbox's two interleaved faces,
// board-on-board's two layers, horizontal boards stacked up the face, bars
// through channel rails, mesh, or nothing on a rail fence. Line posts and
// heavier terminal posts (run ends, corners) are told apart. Without `build`
// the old studio's privacy run comes out unchanged.
//
// GROUND. With `groundAt` the layout also carries where the fence meets the
// land: the ground under every post, and per BAY (post to post) the panel's
// base at each end. A bay follows the ground (racked — rails parallel to the
// grade) unless its segment is priced STEPPED, in which case the bay is level
// at its uphill end and the run drops a step at every post — and a bay that
// would drop more than one code step (MAX_STEP_DROP_FT) is split into shorter
// bays with extra posts, exactly the steps the takeoff charges for. A post
// carries the highest panel of the bays it holds, so a step post is the
// taller one. Without `groundAt` every height is 0 and the result is the old
// flat fence.
