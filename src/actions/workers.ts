// decline, but a worker WITH a password is redirected off that portal to
// /dashboard/jobs — which until now had no way to answer an offer, so the
// email's "Confirm or decline" ended in a dead click. These two run on the
// session instead of the token: the offers feed drives the jobs page's offer
// popup (and its poll), and the response writes the same JobAssignment status
// the portal endpoints write.
