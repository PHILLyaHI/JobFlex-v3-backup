 * and the homeowner's request quietly stopped moving. A decline has to undo the
 * match AND send the lead onward:
 *
 *   1. the shop's Lead row goes LOST (out of their Incoming tab),
 *   2. the pass is recorded as a DECLINED LeadOffer so no path ever offers the
 *      same shop this lead again (the cascade skips orgs it has already asked),
 *   3. the PlatformLead is un-matched and re-driven — the cascade offers it to
 *      the next-best shop, or, when the platform is routing by hand, it is
 *      offered straight to the next-best shop.
