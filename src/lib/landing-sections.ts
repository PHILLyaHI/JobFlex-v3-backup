// THE LANDING'S SECTIONS, in page order (2026-10-02) — shared by the
// landing's section tracker (which fires `landing_section` as each is
// reached) and the admin's analyst (which reads how far visitors get). No
// imports on purpose: the tracker ships in the landing's JavaScript.
//
// Each section is found by the first selector that matches: the block's own
// id, or its content-visibility wrapper (`.lp-cv--…` in landing-e-page.tsx)
// which has a laid-out box even before the block is rendered. `shown` says
// which pages carry it: some sections are trade-specific.
//
// ONE LIST, AND A LANDING MAY ORDER IT ITS OWN WAY (2026-10-04). The list
// below is the page as every landing lays it out unless it is named in
// OWN_ORDER; landing-e-page.tsx renders its blocks in landingSectionOrder(),
// the tracker numbers them by it and the analyst reads such a landing apart,
// in its own order — so the page, the beacon and the reading cannot drift.

   demo after that — "put the estimator demo directly under the hero, it is
   what the ad showed; the comparison after the proof, near the pricing".

   list above. Keys are the landing's variant key (landing-variants.ts).

   `since` is when the order went live. The page and the tracker lay the
   sections out as they are now; the analyst reads a week of visits, and a
   visit from before `since` saw the usual order — it is read in that one,
