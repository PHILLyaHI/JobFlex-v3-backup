// One module, imported by BOTH sides, which is the whole point: the preview
// card in the CRM (desktop `crm-behavior.ts`, mobile `mobile-crm.tsx`) renders

// transport. There is no second set of words anywhere.
//
// PURE — no I/O, no `db`, no `process.env`. It is imported into client bundles.
//
// WHY THE COPY LIVES HERE AND NOT IN AN EmailTemplate ROW. A follow-up rule
// used to carry a template id, which meant the contractor had to author (and
// keep authoring) reminder copy before a rule could say anything useful. The
// rule already knows the ONE thing that determines what to say — the proposal
// status that fired it — so the wording is derived from the trigger and the
// template field is gone. `FollowUpRule.template` now stores the rule's send
// CHANNEL instead (see `parseChannel`), which is the only per-rule choice left.
