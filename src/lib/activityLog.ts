// THE TRAIL (2026-09-24) — server module.
//
// Owner: "check all workers, managers and the others — does what they do
// reflect on the owner's side?" Before this, about six actions in ten changed
// data and wrote nothing: a manager's expense, a crew member's photo from the
// phone link, a sales rep's new client, an estimator's roof estimate. Every
// action writes here now, with the person on it, in one sentence the owner
// can read. Never throws: a trail that cannot be written must not fail the
// work it describes.
//
// `meta.jobId` ties a row to a job (ActivityEvent has no jobId column); the
// job page reads its timeline through it.
