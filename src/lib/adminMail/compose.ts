// WRITING TO ONE CONTRACTOR FROM THE ADMIN (owner, 2026-10-08: "an option in
// admin … write an email to them right off the card … it would extract his
// name, what trial he is on, if he's HVAC or a remodeler or a fence guy … the
// speech button … convert it into a professional email … sends right away …
// topics we would click, like offer 10% discount, already pre-built").
//
// THIS FILE IS PURE — no database, no network — so the composer can draft a
// topic in the browser the moment it is clicked, the server builds the very
// same email it previewed, and scripts/qa/admin-mail.check.ts proves every
// topic on made-up accounts. The I/O is in ./server.ts.
//
// IT READS LIKE A LETTER, NOT A CAMPAIGN (owner, 2026-10-08: "make it not
// go to spam"). A person writing to one customer: plain paragraphs, one
// link, a signature, a plain-text twin of every word, the sender's own name
// on the From line, subjects without prices, percentages or "free", and a
// one-click unsubscribe (./optout) that is honoured. No images, no tracking.
//
// EVERY SENTENCE IS TRUE OF THE ACCOUNT IT GOES TO. A topic is offered only
// where it applies (a trial reminder to a trial with no card, a thank-you to
// a paying shop, a win-back to an ended one), its words come from the
// account's own facts, and the 10% offer exists only where sending it also
// applies the discount (./server.ts): a mail never promises money the
// customer will not see.
