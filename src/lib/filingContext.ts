// FILING CONTEXT — where the next estimate's proposal is filed (2026-09-18).
//
// "New proposal" on a project (or on a client's page) opens the estimator
// picker, and the contractor may pick ANY engine — Smart Proposal, roof, fence,
// HVAC, video. None of those engines read a client or a project from the URL,
// several are mounted with no props at all on a phone, and one is a DOM
// behaviour script; threading two ids through each of them would be five
// separate plumbing jobs that drift. So the picker records the choice in one
// short-lived cookie, a chip on the estimator page says so out loud (with an ×
// to drop it), and every convert-to-proposal action reads it here, on the
// server, when it creates the proposal — then clears it.
//
// The cookie carries ids and display names. Only the ids are trusted, and only
// after they are checked against the caller's organization: a client that is
// deleted or foreign, or a project that is archived or foreign, is ignored.
//
// A LEAD RIDES THE SAME COOKIE (owner, 2026-09-26). An estimate started from a
// lead's page (actions/leadEstimate) records the lead beside its client, for
// as long as the filing lives — the ten-minute hand-off seed is spent the
// moment the estimator opens, and a roof can take longer than that to measure.
// Every convert action then gives the proposal the lead's client (made from
// the lead now if none could be at hand-off) and keeps BOTH scopes: the one
// the estimator wrote stays the Scope of work, the lead's becomes the Overview
// (leadProposalText) — neither is ever written over the other.
