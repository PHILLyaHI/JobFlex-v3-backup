// ORDERING AN ADDRESS PACK BY PACK — the planner behind measureRoofInstant.
//
// Until 2026-09-08 one request asked EagleView for all seven diagram packs;
// when the account lost its entitlement to any one of them the whole order
// was refused (403 / 10880) and the page got nothing, though pack 001 still
// orders. This module buys what can be bought:
//
//   1. [001] alone. It is the roof area, the one pack a measurement cannot do
//      without: a refusal here is the caller's error, as before.
//   2. ONE request for every other pack the account is known to be entitled
//      to (`live` in EagleViewEntitlement). Refused → the entitlement changed
//      since it was recorded, so fall through to 3 for those packs.
//   3. Pack by pack, in PROBE_ORDER, for everything unknown, stale-denied, or
//      knocked out of step 2. 202 → live; 403 → denied (a refusal is free);
//      anything else → failed, verdict unchanged.
//
// PLACE FIRST, COLLECT TOGETHER (review 2026-09-17). Until then every accepted
// order was polled to completion — up to 30 s each — before the next one was
// even placed, so a first click on a new address could wait 30 s × 7 and the
// function limit cut it off with the area pack collected and the rest never
// ordered. Now every order is PLACED before any is waited for, and the placed
// orders are collected in one round-robin wait under a single budget: one
// result request at a time, each order asked in turn every couple of seconds.
// An order still processing when the budget runs out is reported as
// `pending` — placed, paid, and collected later without a new charge
// (collectPendingInstant) — never as failed and never re-ordered.
//
// Whatever the billing model, only accepted packs are paid for: EagleView
// rejects a refused request whole. Every accepted request is written to the
// ledger BEFORE its first poll, exactly as the single order was (a lost
// requestId is a paid result nobody can fetch).
//
// Plain module, no "use server": the I/O comes in through `deps`, so the plan
// can be exercised against fakes without ordering anything.
