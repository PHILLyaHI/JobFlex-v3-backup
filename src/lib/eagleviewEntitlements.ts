// Which EagleView Property Data packs the ACCOUNT may order.
//
// A 403 / 10880 on a pack is a fact about the credentials, not about the
// address that was being ordered (2026-09-08: pack 001 orders, the seven-pack
// order does not — the entitlement is partial). So the record lives here,
// account-wide, not per address and not per organization:
//
//   live    an order for this pack was accepted (billed) — the pack is on.
//   denied  a single-pack order came back 403. A refusal costs nothing, so a
//           denied pack is probed again once the record is older than a day.
//   no row  never probed.
//
// The reader is lib/eagleviewOrder (the order planner); the only writers are
// that planner and scripts/eagleview-recheck-entitlements.ts, which resets
// the table so the next order re-probes everything.
