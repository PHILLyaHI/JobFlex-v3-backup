// THE CUSTOM PLAN — pay for the pages you actually open.
//
// Every other plan is a bundle somebody else decided. This one starts at
// BASE_CENTS with the everyday workspace included, and each of the pages below
// is a PAID ADD-ON at PAGE_CENTS. A shop that only wants the manual builder and
// the client book pays the base; one that wants the estimators and the crew
// tools pays for exactly those.
//
// WHAT IS IN THE BASE, and why these are the ones that are not:
// the base is the paperwork a contractor cannot work without — the dashboard,
// proposals (manual builder included), clients, projects, CRM, jobs, messages,
// financials, announcements, reviews. The add-ons are the machines and the
// team surfaces: every ESTIMATOR except the manual builder, plus Company,
// Workers, Phone, Calendar and Leads.
//
// Shared by the signup picker (client) and the checkout route (server). The
// server NEVER prices from the client's number: it re-runs `customPriceCents`
// over the stored selection, so a doctored request buys nothing cheaper.
