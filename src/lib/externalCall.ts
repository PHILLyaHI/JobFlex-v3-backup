// The one contract for calling an external service.
//
// The audit of 2026-08-28 found twelve external calls in twelve states: one
// with no timeout at all (the legacy EagleView Reports API), most with a
// ceiling but no retry, four swallowing every failure into a bare null or [],
// and only two — Solar and Instant, the two that had already burned the owner —
// distinguishing "the service did not answer" from "the service answered:
// nothing here". Each incident got its own hand-rolled fix, which is how the
// three retry loops this file replaces came to exist (§K7: duplicated helper
// code duplicates its bugs).
//
// THE DISTINCTION THIS ENCODES, because every consumer needs it and almost none
// had it: a failure to ANSWER (timeout, dropped connection, 5xx, rate limit)
// justifies retrying now and telling the user to try again later; an ANSWER of
// "no data" (404, no coverage) makes both of those wrong — retrying wastes
// spend and telling the user to retry wastes their time. Conflating the two is
// exactly how a network hiccup got captioned "no usable aerial elevation data
// for this address" on a house that measured 16 facets the day before.
//
// RETRY POLICY, solarFetch's rules: 429 and 5xx and aborts are asked again with
// doubling backoff; any other 4xx is an answer and is not. Services override
// where their semantics differ — ReportAll's 429 means an ALLTIME quota is
// exhausted, so asking again is not merely useless but wrong, and a call that
// PLACES A BILLED ORDER sets attempts to 1 because a timeout does not say
// whether the order landed.

/**
 * Why the call failed, in the two-way split that matters plus the two flavours
 * of "answered no" that need different handling:
 *
 *   unreachable  the service did not answer: timeout, network, 5xx, 429 after
 *                retries. Trying again later is reasonable.
 *   no-data      the service answered that it has nothing here: 404, or a
 *                status the service's policy lists as meaning that. Retrying
 *                changes nothing; the user should not be told to try again.
 *   auth         401/403 — our credentials or entitlement. Ours to fix.
 *   refused      any other 4xx: the request was understood and turned down.
