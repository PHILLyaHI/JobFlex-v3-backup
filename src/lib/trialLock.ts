// THE WRITE LOCK AFTER A CARD-LESS TRIAL (owner, 2026-10-01): "the dashboard
// reads, writing is blocked" until a card is added (lib/trialState).
//
// HOW IT IS ENFORCED WITHOUT TOUCHING 450 SERVER ACTIONS. Writes in this app
// go through server actions, and every one of them resolves its organization
// with requireOrg (lib/orgContext). requireOrg notes, for the request it runs
// in, that the organization is locked — only when the request IS a server
// action (the `next-action` header). The database client (lib/db) then
// refuses every create / update / delete in a noted request, except on the
// housekeeping models below. Reads are never touched, so a server action
// that only loads data keeps working, and page renders (GET) are never noted
// at all.
//
// The note is keyed by the request's own headers object — the same object
// for every `headers()` call within one request — so it lives exactly as long
// as the request. Outside a request (crons, webhooks, scripts) `headers()`
// throws and nothing is ever locked. No database import here: lib/db imports
// this module.

/** What the owner reads when a write is refused. */

 * generic "An error occurred in the Server Components render…" — so the error
 * also carries Next's redirect digest: Next treats it as `redirect()` and the
 * browser lands on /dashboard/trial?locked=1, which says what happened and
 * offers the card. Same in dev and in a production build.
