// WHAT A DECK IS BUILT FROM (2026-10-04) — pure data.
//
// Owner: "add to the selections all options of wood type that's used in the
// USA for the decks." Three shelves:
//
//   · FRAMING — the species a frame is cut from, each tied to the code's
//     species row its spans are read from (codeTables.ts). The code wants
//     pressure-treated lumber or naturally durable heartwood under a deck
//     (R507.2.1), so "not pressure-treated" is offered only as redwood or
//     cedar heartwood — never as plain untreated fir.
//   · DECKING — the boards the client walks on: treated softwoods, the
//     naturally durable ones, the tropical and domestic hardwoods, modified
//     woods, capped composite, PVC, mineral-based boards and aluminum. Each
//     carries the widest joist spacing it may sit on and WHERE that rule
//     was read: the code's table for sawn wood, the maker's guide where one
//     was read, or the yard's practice (`source: "trade"` — confirm it).
//   · THE WALL — what the house is where the deck meets it, because that
//     decides whether a ledger may be bolted on at all.
//
// PRICES. No public price list was found for any of this, so every price
// here is an EXAMPLE (the owner asked for placeholders he can replace). The
// shop's own numbers live in its price book (rates.ts) and win over these.
