// A DECK AS THE CONTRACTOR DESCRIBES IT (2026-10-04) — pure.
//
// Everything the studio's steps collect, in one plain object: the shape, how
// it meets the house, how high it stands, what it is framed and decked with.
// The frame itself is NOT stored here — frame.ts works it out from this, the
// same way every time, so the 3D, the material list and the price are three
// readings of one design and can never disagree.
//
// Lengths the contractor types are feet (the outline) and inches (heights);
// the engine works in inches inside.
//
// `normalizeDeckDesign` reads anything claiming to be a design — a saved
// one, a half-typed one — and gives back one the engine can build: numbers
// inside their rails, a choice that the wall or the species rules out moved
// to the nearest one that stands. It never throws.
