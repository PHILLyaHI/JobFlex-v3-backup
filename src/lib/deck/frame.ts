// THE DECK'S FRAME, WORKED OUT (2026-10-04) — pure.
//
// Owner: "you select the perimeter, you choose the joist … and it starts
// building." A design goes in (design.ts); out comes every stick of the
// frame with its size, its length and where it sits — joists, rim, ledger,
// beams, posts, blocking, braces — and every footing. The 3D draws these
// sticks, the material list counts them, the checks read their spans. One
// frame, three readings.
//
// HOW IT DECIDES (each choice a contractor can override in the studio):
//
//   · Joists run out from the house. The deck is one rectangle or two
//     (an L); each rectangle is framed on its own supports.
//   · The fewest beam lines first, then the smallest joist that spans:
//     a size is tried on a single span, and a middle beam is added only
//     when no size in the table reaches.
//   · A DROPPED beam sits under the joists and they run past it — up to
//     2 ft by default, never past what the joist table allows. A FLUSH
//     beam is in the joists' plane, the joists hang on it, and it is what
//     a deck too low for a beam underneath gets.
//   · Each beam takes the size and the post count that cost least
//     together: a deeper beam against one more post, footing and hole.
//   · A deck that cannot hang on the house (brick veneer, an overhang,
//     framing nobody can see) gets a second beam line by the house.
//
// HOW A SPAN IS MEASURED. Face of support to face of support, as the code
// measures it: from the ledger's face (1 1/2 in. off the wall) to the near
// face of the beam, a beam's bearing taken as 3 in. wide. The cantilever is
// from the beam's far face to the edge of the deck.
//
// WHAT IS OUTSIDE THE TABLES IS SAID, NOT HIDDEN. A middle beam carries
// joists on both sides, which the code's beam table is not printed for: it
// is sized from the strip of deck it really carries (codeTables
// effectiveSpanFromTributaryFt) and flagged for the building office. A post
// past 14 ft, an area past 160 sq ft on one post, a joist past 18 ft on a
// ledger: flagged as an engineer's.
