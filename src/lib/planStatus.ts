// WHETHER A PLAN STILL OPENS ITS FEATURES — one rule for every door
// (owner, 2026-10-07). The limits engine (quotas), the feature tier
// (lib/orgPlan, planCatalogServer.getOrgPlanContext) and the page gate
// (lib/customPageAccess) all ask this, so a cancelled shop cannot keep the
// estimators because one of them only looked at the plan's name.
//
//   · ACTIVE and PAST_DUE keep the plan until the paid period is over (plus
//     a 3-day grace for webhook lag). PAST_DUE is a failed renewal Stripe is
//     still retrying: the shop keeps working under the "Payment failed"
//     ribbon while it updates the card.
//   · TRIALING keeps it until the trial (or the period) ends.
//   · CANCELED, UNPAID (Stripe gave up retrying), EXPIRED and TRIAL_ENDED (a
//     card-less trial that ran out) close it at once. A cancellation booked
//     for the period's end is still ACTIVE/TRIALING until Stripe ends it.
//   · No subscription, or FREE, is not a lapse: there is nothing to close.
//
// Database-free, so the edge of every check can call it on a row it already
// holds.
