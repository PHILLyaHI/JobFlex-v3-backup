// WHAT A JOB HAS COST (stage D, 2026-09-30) — server, ONE function for the
// job page and Financials.
//
// The owner's rule, "job or stock": the company's totals count money once,
// the day it is spent (lib/expenseTotals, actions/financials); a job's cost
// counts what the job CONSUMED:
//
//   crew     — the pay on its assignments (all of it, paid or not);
//   receipts — its approved receipts (APPROVED + REIMBURSED; a receipt on
//              review stands apart and is never added);
//   stock    — what was issued to it from the warehouse: PICKED and USED
//              movements, less what was RETURNED, each at the movement's own
//              unitCost, else the item's lastCost, else 0 — and a line with
//              no price at all is named in `unpriced`, so the page can say so.
//
// A purchase FOR STOCK is a company expense and the warehouse's value; it is
// never a job's cost until the stock is issued, so nothing is counted twice.
// Financials' "Cost by job" and the job page's money card both read this, so
// the two agree to the cent — scripts/qa/worker-expenses.check.ts proves it.
