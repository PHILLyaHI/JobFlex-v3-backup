// THE MIRROR'S STATUS FOR A STRIPE SUBSCRIPTION — one answer for every path
// that writes or compares Subscription.status from Stripe (owner, 2026-10-07):
// the webhook and the reconcile cron (lib/stripeSync), the admin's "Sync from
// Stripe" (actions/adminUsers), the admin's subscription editor
// (lib/subscriptionEditor) and its syncing mark (lib/planGrant). Each of them
// had its own copy of the switch below, and the admin sync's knew nothing of
// the card-less trial: it rewrote TRIAL_ENDED as CANCELED, which dropped the
// "Trial ended" ribbon, lifted the write lock and lost the way back through
// "Add a card".
//
// No database, no client: the two functions read the subscription alone.
