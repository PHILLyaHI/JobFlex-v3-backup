// WHAT A COMPANY KEEPS IN STOCK BY DEFAULT (2026-09-23) — pure.
//
// Owner: "not every contractor stocks everything to get the job done … let
// them check-box what they're stocking, then calculate on that … make it
// understandable how to set up the inventory." The stock list starts from a
// suggestion per trade, one rule a contractor can read in a sentence:
//   roof   the small stuff every truck carries — underlayment, ice & water,
//          drip edge, starter, flashing, boots, vents, nails, sealants — is
//          kept in stock; shingles, membranes and coatings are bought per
//          job: the colour and the system change with every roof.
//   fence  posts, rails, concrete, fasteners, caps and gate hardware are
//          kept in stock; pickets, boards, panels and fabric — and the vinyl,
//          composite, aluminum, steel and chain-link systems — per job.
//   hvac   the parts a service truck carries — capacitors, contactors,
//          motors, thermostats, line sets, disconnects, drains — are kept in
//          stock; the equipment (condensers, furnaces, coils, air handlers,
//          water heaters) is ordered per job.
// A suggestion only: the checklist is the contractor's to change, and an
// item they add by hand is stocked — they added it to track it.
