//
// Ported 2026-09-18 from the owner's FenceScan app (lib/fence/catalog.ts):
// the same fence types, build specs, spacings, rail counts, picket pitches
// and national starting rates, so both apps price a fence the same way.
// One type is JobFlex's own: composite privacy, which the page already
// offered as a material.
//
// Geometry model used across the page:
//  - a fence LAYOUT is a set of runs (polylines) with corners where a run
//    bends, ends where it stops, and gates placed on runs;
//  - POSTS: line posts every `postSpacingFt`, plus one at every corner,
//    end, and both sides of every gate;
//  - wood fences are stick-built (rails + pickets); vinyl/aluminum/steel/
//    composite come as prefab PANELS per section; chain link is mesh +
//    framework; split and ranch rail are rails alone.
