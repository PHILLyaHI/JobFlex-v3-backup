// A CEILING ON CARD-LESS TRIALS PER DAY (owner, 2026-10-02) — server only.
//
// The per-person brakes (lib/trialGuard: per IP, per mailbox, per company
// domain, a confirmed address, no throwaway inbox) stop one person taking the
// trial twice. They do not stop a hundred people — or one script with a
// hundred mailboxes — taking it once each. So at most CARDLESS_TRIALS_PER_DAY
// card-less trials start in any 24 hours (default 100). Past it the signup
// goes on as before, but the trial asks for a card: the plan step opens
// Stripe Checkout (the TRIAL_REQUIRES_CARD flow) for the rest of the window.
// When the count crosses 80% of the ceiling, support hears about it once.
//
// THE COUNT is one SyncState row per started trial, `trial-start:<orgId>`,
// written when the confirmation link creates the account and never changed;
// the window is the last 24 hours of those rows (updatedAt is their birth).
