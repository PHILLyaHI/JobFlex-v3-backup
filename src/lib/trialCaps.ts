// THE CARD-LESS TRIAL'S OWN CEILINGS (owner, 2026-10-02) — client-safe.
//
// A trial that asks for no card is a trial anybody can take, and some of the
// app's buttons spend our money with a third party on every press (the map in
// lib/paidApiCosts). So while an organization is on a card-less trial WITH NO
// CARD ON FILE, the paid features run under fixed ceilings of their own,
// whatever plan the trial was started on. A card added during the trial
// lifts them: the plan's own limits apply from that moment. A trial that has
// ended with no card gets none of them (the workspace is read-only too —
// lib/trialLock). The counting and the refusal live in lib/trialMeter.
//
// A ceiling counts ACTIONS a person takes, not requests underneath: one
// "Measure this roof" is one roof measurement however many calls it makes.
