//
// Two callers need exactly this (2026-10-02): the free Accept
// (actions/leadOffers.ts acceptLeadOffer) and a paid lead's unlock
// (lib/leadCenter/purchase.ts), which runs it inside the same transaction that
// records the payment. A paid offer also stamps `unlockedAt`.
//
// Plain server module (NOT "use server") — callers do the auth.
