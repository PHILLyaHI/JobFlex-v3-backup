// Free aerial roof reconstruction, as a reusable build step.
//
// This is the body that used to live inside the `reconRoofPreview` server
// action: geocode → Google Solar data layers → DSM + building mask → parcel
// scoping → pitch priors → reconstructRoof → provenance. It was moved here so
// the roof-diagram pipeline (src/actions/roofMeasurement.ts) can run the same
// reconstruction in PARALLEL with a billed EagleView Instant lookup and keep
// the rasters + diagnostics the action used to throw away — the DSM and mask
// feed chimney detection, `groundElevFt` puts DSM heights above ground, and
// `origin` is the frame every later stage shares.
//
// No auth and no env guard in here: every caller is a server action that has
// already run requireEstimatorOrManager() and isSolarEnabled(). Failures that
// used to be `{ ok: false, error }` returns are thrown as ReconUnavailableError
// carrying the SAME user-facing message, so the preview action can stay a thin
// `try { … } catch → { ok: false, error: err.message }` wrapper.
//
// Coordinate frame of the returned model: the tile's local-feet frame — origin
// at the queried pin (the Solar tile centre), x east, y north, z feet above
// ground. Geo rings convert into it via latLngRingToFrame(origin, ring).
