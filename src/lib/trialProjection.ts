// WHAT THE FREE TRIALS ARE LIKELY TO BRING EACH MONTH (owner, 2026-10-05:
// "where the signup total is, add projected revenue from the free trials per
// month — make it smart"). Pure: the server reads the rows
// (actions/trafficDashboard getSignupLedger), this decides what they mean.
//
// A trial is worth its plan's MONTHLY price — the monthly or the yearly price
// it was started on, a yearly one divided by twelve, a custom plan by the
// pages it picked — times the chance it pays. The chance comes from what the
// account has done, strongest signal first:
//
//   card on file   a card-less trial that added a card converts on its own
//                  on day 8 unless the owner cancels — 90 %;
//   trial over     the trial ended with no card; a card can still restart
//                  it, but rarely does — 5 %;
//   working        made a proposal, or three records (clients, jobs, leads),
//                  or used the app on three different days — 45 %;
//   trying         made something, or came back on a second day, or opened
//                  ten screens — 20 %;
//   just started   under a day old with nothing yet: too early to tell — 15 %;
//   quiet          a day or more and nothing done — 6 %.
//
// Those are starting points for a card-less B2B trial, not facts about
// JobFlex. As trials finish, the shop's own record takes over: every
// card-less trial that ended either added a card (or restarted with one) or
// lapsed, and that rate — pulled toward the 20 % starting point by five
// imaginary trials so two lucky signups cannot triple the forecast — scales
// every tier between the two certain ones. The panel prints both numbers.
//
// List prices: a promo code or a referral discount is not taken off.
