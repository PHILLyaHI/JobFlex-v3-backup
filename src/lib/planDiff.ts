// rows themselves — the features an admin typed on /admin/plans — never from
// copy written into a component, so a plan edited in the console changes what
// the dialog promises the same day.
//
// "Everything in <plan>" rolls up the way lib/planCatalog.expandPlanFeatures
// rolls it up, so Enterprise reads as including Starter's basics and the diff
// against Starter is only what Enterprise actually adds.
