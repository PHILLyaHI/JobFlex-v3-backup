# JobFlex — current Blueprint design

This is the single design specification for JobFlex, for Codex, Claude,
Impeccable and agents with no conversation history. Updated September 23, 2026.
Use it for new work and restyling. Update this file when an owner-approved
design decision changes; do not maintain a second theme specification.

## Intent and hierarchy

JobFlex serves small US contracting businesses, at a desk, on a jobsite and
in front of clients. A surface should reveal its purpose, current state and
next action at a glance. Keep working data and actions visible. Use short,
specific copy; move secondary explanations into an accessible disclosure.

The current Blueprint is a crisp engineering sheet: drafting-paper background,
white surfaces, ink frames, strong uppercase headings and restrained blue
actions. Structure comes from alignment, spacing and continuous rules.
No soft SaaS cards, rounded pills, glass, gradients, blurred shadows, grain
over text, ornamental drawing numbers or decorative metrics.

## Authority and working examples

1. This specification defines the design intent.
2. [globals.css](src/app/globals.css) defines the shared token values.
3. These maintained components demonstrate the current treatment:
   - [Meta connection](src/components/v3/settings-blueprint/meta-connection.tsx)
     and its [styles](src/components/v3/settings-blueprint/meta-connection.module.css):
     framed card, status stamp, annotation labels, section rules and action row.
   - [Roofing inventory desktop](src/components/v3/roofing-inventory/roofing-inventory-desktop.tsx)
     and [styles](src/components/v3/roofing-inventory/roofing-inventory-desktop.module.css):
     dense working tables, filters, clear item hierarchy and management actions.
   - [Roofing inventory mobile](src/components/v3/roofing-inventory/roofing-inventory-mobile.tsx)
     and [styles](src/components/v3/roofing-inventory/roofing-inventory-mobile.module.css):
     a dedicated handheld composition of the same functionality.

Examples show patterns, not a template to copy into every page. A quiet table
label or text action need not become a stamp. Match each element's role.
Existing components outside this list are implementation context, not automatic
approval of every visual choice. Prior prototypes and historical notes do not
override this specification. If code and this document conflict, flag the
specific discrepancy rather than silently selecting another theme.

## Tokens and surfaces

Use CSS custom properties; do not paste a palette into new components.

| Purpose | Existing token |
| --- | --- |
| Drafting-paper background | `--paper` |
| White surface | `--paper-deep`; `--sheet` in mobile scopes that define it |
| Main text and frames | `--ink` |
| Body / secondary text | `--ink-soft` / `--ink-muted` |
| Quiet repeated row separators | `--ink-line` |
| Primary blue / hover / soft fill | `--accent` / `--accent-ink` / `--accent-soft` |
| Success / warning / error | `--emerald` / `--amber` / `--rose` |
| Sans / annotation type | `--font-sans` / `--font-mono` |
| Near-square corners | `--r-sm` (2px) |
| Motion | `--ease-out`, `--ease-soft`, `--ease-draw` |

Some existing mobile scopes give `--paper-deep` a recessed-paper meaning.
Inspect the consuming scope; use `var(--sheet, var(--paper-deep))` for a shared
white card where appropriate. Do not globally repurpose a token to fix one card.
Use existing semantic status tones where available; otherwise derive a soft
fill from the status token. Status color conveys state, not decoration.

Light mode only. Keep the existing drafting grid behind content, never over
type. Resting cards have no shadow (`--shadow-sm` and `--shadow-md` are `none`).
An existing hard ink hover treatment may be retained on interactive controls;
do not give static cards decorative elevation.

## Typography

- Keep Inter through `--font-sans`; do not choose a new font per page.
- Page and card headings: weight 800–900, uppercase, compact line height.
  Large headings use tight tracking; small section titles can use slight
  positive tracking. Typical working sizes: page 28–32px, card 16–20px,
  key entity 22–24px, section 12–14px. Fit the page's existing hierarchy.
- Body and user data stay readable, typically 13–16px, with normal casing.
  Do not uppercase paragraphs, editable input values or whole tables.
- Use JetBrains Mono only for short annotations, units and technical labels,
  usually 10–12px with measured tracking. Do not make navigation, paragraphs
  or large amounts monospace.
- Amounts use Inter with tabular numerals; important totals use weight 800–900.
- Status stamps: near-square frame, 10–11px, weight 800, uppercase, tracking
  about .1em, a semantic border and soft fill. Always include readable text.
- Keep the global font-rendering settings; no page-specific smoothing reset.

## Layout, frames and controls

- Main card frames: 1.5–2px ink. Major internal boundaries: 1px ink,
  edge-to-edge within the frame. Use quieter separators for repeated rows.
  Adjacent borders must not double in thickness or cross labels or links.
- Use a 4px spacing scale. Start with 24px desktop card padding and 20px
  mobile padding; 8px within a label/value group, 16–24px between groups.
  Adapt density to the task rather than filling unused space with copy.
- Keep one clear primary action per task group: blue surface, white text,
  visible ink border, near-square corners and a concise verb label.
  The Meta card's primary actions use bold uppercase text; quieter secondary
  actions may use normal casing as in the inventory reference.
- Controls must have visible focus, hover, disabled and busy states. Disabled
  styling must not be mistaken for an available action. Minimum mobile hit
  area is 44×44px; labelled full-width actions are useful on narrow cards.
- Use existing Lucide icons at consistent sizes; decorative icons are hidden
  from assistive technology, icon-only controls have accessible names.
- Preserve all existing actions, validation, units, permissions and data
  states during a redesign. Do not fabricate metrics, statuses or success.
- Reuse the live shared sidebar, navigation map and responsive shell.
  Sidebar subpage toggles are separate buttons with hover and expanded state;
  nested links retain consistent type and a clear indentation guide.

## Mobile and motion

Use the existing viewport switch at **≤768px** and its dynamically imported
mobile component. Exactly one layout tree mounts. Reuse shared logic and data;
compose the mobile surface for handheld use. No UA detection, new zoom system,
copied standalone HTML shell or alternate mobile palette.

Keep lists visible while filtering, selecting and editing. No opacity-zero
entrance dependency or MutationObserver that replays the whole list. Use
short state transitions: about 120–180ms for hover and 200–350ms for a panel.
Support `prefers-reduced-motion`. Loading feedback follows actual work and
keeps the layout stable. Never delay usable content for an animation.

Long names must wrap or have an accessible way to view the full value. Use
`min-width: 0` on flex/grid children and `overflow-wrap: anywhere` where needed.
Keep key mobile data available; do not hide functionality to make a layout fit.

## Implementation and review

Read [implementation notes](docs/design/implementation.md) when editing an
existing interactive surface, and [mobile notes](docs/design/mobile.md) for
handheld work. These describe code hazards, not alternative visual themes.

Before delivery, verify the changed surface in its actual shell at desktop
width and 390×844. Check long content, focus, overflow, touch targets, loading,
empty/error/connected states as applicable, and all preserved actions. Use
relevant existing lint/type checks. Report what was actually verified; a
redirect or compilation alone is not visual verification. Do not create test
scaffolding, change the data layer, commit or publish unless authorized.
