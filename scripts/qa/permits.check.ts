// The owner (2026-10-09): a door swap came back with "Permit and inspection".
// Not every job takes a permit — electrical, plumbing, gas, HVAC equipment,
// structure, additions and full remodels do; a door or window in its opening,
// tile, paint, flooring, a fixture swap and a repair do not; a roof or a
// re-side is the city's call. This holds the call on 55 briefs, on the prompt
// (decision block last, permit step gone from the procedure), on the
// validator (no permit demanded unless required, one inserted when it is) and
// on the final estimate (a stray permit line dropped, the reason said once).
