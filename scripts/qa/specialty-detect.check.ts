// 2026-10-09: briefs were filed under the wrong trade, and the trade decides
// the procedure, the price book, the range, the intake questions and the
// permit. A re-roof with "architectural shingles" went to architect (the
// word-substring bias), "asphalt shingles" to asphalt paving, a deck "on
// existing framing" to framing, new circuits "in the garage" to garage
// building; "shingles", "furnace" and "mini-split" voted for roofing and HVAC
// and the vote was dropped whenever the trade's own description shared no
// word with the brief; AC, lights, switches and sod named no trade at all.
